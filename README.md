    - compare this against hate crimes especially (as well as income, educ)
    
    
- White poverty vs. Trump
- Correlations that are low 
    - liberal-tending people usually assume that largely uneducated people // 
      unemployed people looked to Trump to solve problems -- but these values 
      show that's not necessarily the case
